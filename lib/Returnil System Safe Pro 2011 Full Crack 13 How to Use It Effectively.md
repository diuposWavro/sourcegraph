Returnil System Safe Pro 2011 is a security software that combines antivirus, anti-malware and virtualization technology to protect your computer from all kinds of threats. It creates a virtual copy of your system and runs your applications in a sandbox, so that any changes or infections are isolated and can be easily reverted by rebooting. It also has a cloud-based protection feature that scans your files with multiple engines and a file manager that allows you to save your documents from the virtual system to the real one.

Returnil System Safe Pro 2011 has several advantages over traditional security software. It does not slow down your system or consume a lot of resources, as it runs your applications in a virtual environment. It also protects your privacy and personal data, as it deletes your online traces and any malware infections when you reboot. It also allows you to test new software or browse risky websites without worrying about damaging your system.
 
However, Returnil System Safe Pro 2011 also has some limitations and drawbacks. It does not protect your system from hardware failures or physical damage, as it only works on the software level. It also does not backup your files or settings, as it only saves them temporarily in the virtual system. It also requires you to restart your system every time you want to switch between the virtual and the real mode, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming.
 
Therefore, Returnil System Safe Pro 2011 is not a complete solution for your security needs. You should still use a reliable backup software to backup your important files and settings regularly. You should also use a firewall and a VPN to protect your network and online activities from hackers and snoopers. You should also be careful about what you download and install on your system, as some malware can bypass the virtualization protection.
