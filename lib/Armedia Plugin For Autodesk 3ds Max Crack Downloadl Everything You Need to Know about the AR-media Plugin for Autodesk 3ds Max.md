## Installing the Armedia Plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max

## Using the Armedia Plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max
 
When you install the plugin, you will see the Armedia Plugin's toolbar which is your quick access point to the main functionalities:
 ![Armedia Plugin's Toolbar](https://www.inglobetechnologies.com/ar-media/documentation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AR-media-Plugin-for-3ds-Max-Toolbar.png) 
Using the toolbar you can:

- Export the whole scene
- Export selected models only
- Go to your Armedia Studio account

You usually have to go to your Armedia Studio account to:

- Retrieve your personal token (or a specific model token as described below)
- Verify, manage and try the exported models

Before any export, you need to set your personal plugin token (that you retrieve from your personal account data) to bind the Armedia Extension to your space and resources available on the Armedia Studio platform. When you set a token you can check the "Remember me" option to make the token available among different sessions. Un-check it if you are working on a shared computer and do not want to allow other users to upload models to your account thus consuming your personal storage and limits.

Then to actually export a new model, you need to choose a name for your model. If you want to update a previously exported model instead, you must also specify a model token. The model token is automatically generated each time you export a model and is made available to let you keep working on the very same model asset instead of creating a new asset each time you export your content (this will also help you keeping the platform usage as low as possible).
 
Upon a successful export your model will appear in the Armedia Studio Asset Manager with the chosen model name.
 
Note: Model names have not to be unique even though you'd better choose unique names to distinguish them later on.
 
You set the plugin token, the model name (and optionally the model token) using the plugin's rollout:
 ![Armedia Rollout](https://www.inglobetechnologies.com/ar-media/documentation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AR-media-Plugin-for-3ds-Max-Rollout.png) 
To export the whole scene click the All button, whereas if you want to export only the current selection then click the Selected button. By clicking the Account button you will be able to login into your account to retrieve the plugin token, a model token (if required), or to verify, manage and test exported models. The
